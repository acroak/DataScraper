# Mockup Frontend

### Made by Charlie :)

This is an incredibly basic frontend app built in react native. 

This app uses the backend mockup's database to display a list of employees on the screen.

To run the app in your web browser use :

```bash
yarn run web
```

If you want to preview it on your phone you can use the expo go app. 

To make styling of components (especially the wall of form components) a bit easier I installed the React Natives' [Paper Library](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/docs/guides/getting-started)
* Please Note: To use Paper you must yarn install 2 libraries react-native-paper and react-native-safe-area-context, these have been added to the package.
